**Installation**

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python.

**Project Motivation**

For this project, I like the analysis for costumers, because i was interestested in using Kaggle data of the Credit Card customers,  data available in https://www.kaggle.com/code/kushal1996/customer-segmentation-k-means-analysis/data. This data this data allowed me to better understand:

1. What is the transactional profile of customers with the highest credit limit?
2. Older customers, given the stage of their lives, are they the ones who use and balance the most on their credit cards?
3. What transactional profiles exist, with the information from the database?
